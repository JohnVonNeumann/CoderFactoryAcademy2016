# CoderFactoryAcademy2016

26th of sept - first commit was made whilst still fleshing out idea, this is named as version1 inside the appropriate folder

30th of sept - 4 more commits were made as a better class hierarchy started to come about and I understood better how my program was going to operate, trying to improve my commenting and general understanding of what I'm doing

#i am basically still learning how to use github with this repository, some of the stuff i have in here is probably redundant and im potentially not using the site properly, learning as i go
