# CoderFactoryAcademy2016

26th of sept - first commit was made whilst still fleshing out idea

30th of sept - 4 more commits were made as a better class hierarchy started to come about and I understood better how my program was going to operate, trying to improve my commenting and general understanding of what I'm doing
